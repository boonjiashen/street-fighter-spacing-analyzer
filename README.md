I'm currently testing on a match in training stage since the background of
training stage is a lot easier. The match is [Infiltration (Gouken) vs Tokido
(Akuma)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuqzhjKHhag).

1. Download [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuqzhjKHhag) as
   `data/my_video.mp4`, with your video downloader of choice
2. Run

I wanted to apply unsupervised learning to the task since I'm lazy to hand-label frames. One method to do so is to cluster patches in a test set and then during inference, cluster all patches of the video frame by frame.

The question then is - which frames do I include in my test set? To answer this, I described every frame in the video as a histogram of its Hue channel (one of the channels in HSV space) and KMeans-clustered the entire video. For every cluster, I took the frame that was closest to the cluster center (I call such a frame an 'exemplar) and included it in the test set. As a pre-processing step to getting the exemplars, I applied the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters in KMeans. This number turns out to be about 10.
